 This project explores the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset to understand how bike rental patterns change with time, weather, holidays, and seasonal factors, and all analysis is carried out inside the `seoul_bike_data.ipynb` notebook.
 The notebook begins with basic data inspection using functions like `info()` and `describe()`, which helps reveal the structure of the dataset, the types of each column, and the overall statistical ranges of the numerical values.

 Additional features such as the month and the day of the week are created so that rental patterns can be analyzed more clearly across different time periods.
 Several visualizations are included to study how rentals vary by season, month, and hour of the day, allowing clear identification of peak usage times and seasonal demand changes.
 The analysis also compares holiday and non-holiday days to show how bike rentals differ between regular working days and days with reduced activity or leisure-focused usage.
 Other plots examine the distribution of rental counts, the presence of outliers, and the balance between functioning and non-functioning days within the dataset.
 
 The entire project is implemented using Python with the help of Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, which together enable data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visual exploration.
 To run the project, you simply need to install the necessary libraries, open the notebook, and execute the cells in sequence to reproduce the complete analysis.
