EDA – EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

📌 Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset to understand the factors influencing bike rental demand. The analysis focuses on identifying trends, correlations, and patterns using statistical methods and visual exploration.

📂 Project Structure
- `assessment_1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing complete EDA
- `SeoulBikeData.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- Checked and handled missing values
- Generated descriptive statistics
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualized trends across seasons, weather conditions, and hours
- Explored relationships between environmental factors and rental counts
  
 📊 Outcome
 Through this analysis, I was able to:
- Identify the key variables affecting bike rental count
- Observe strong seasonal, weather-based, and hourly patterns
- Understand user behavior under different climatic and temporal conditions
- Build clear insights that can support further modelling or forecasting

🚀 How to Run the Project
